// Prime factors

/* A factor of a number is a whole number that divides that number exactly without leaving a remainder. 
For example, factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 because these numbers divide 12 without leaving a remainder.*/

function isPrimeFactors(n) {
  const factors = [];
  let divisor = 2;

  while (n > 2) {
    if (n % divisor === 0) {
      factors.push(divisor);
      n = n / divisor;
    } else {
      divisor++;
    }
  }

  return factors;
}

const numbers = 60;

console.log(`Prime factors of ${numbers}: ${result.join(", ")}`);

/*
First we create an empty array
second we declare divisor by 2
third we run a while loop where we check if n is divided by divisor is equal to zero or nit if yes then 
 (a) first we push the divisor value into array
 (b) second we again divide the n from divisor until we found 1 and we increment the divisor value

 After that we return the factors which shows the value of given numbers in array form
